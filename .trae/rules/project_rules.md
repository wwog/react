Project Guidelines
Primarily provides functional components, adhering to declarative, style-free, type-complete, logic-encapsulated, and bilingual (English/Chinese) JSDoc standards.
Components are AI-friendly, with clear intent conveyed through names—e.g., the current utility set includes If, Switch, ArrayRender, When, Show, Scope, Transform, etc.

(Note: Minor adjustments were made for conciseness and natural flow in English, e.g., "中英文 JSDoc 规范" → "bilingual (English/Chinese) JSDoc standards" for clarity.)
